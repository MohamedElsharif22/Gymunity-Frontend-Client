/* 
  DEPRECATED: This file is no longer used.
  All styling has been migrated to TailwindCSS classes in profile.component.html
  The component now uses only Tailwind utility classes.
  
  Previously, this file contained ~490 lines of native CSS.
  All styles have been converted to equivalent TailwindCSS utilities.
  
  Examples of conversions:
  - .form-input { padding: 0.75rem; border: 1px solid #cbd5e0; }
    → class="px-3 py-3 border border-gray-300"
    
  - .alert-error { background-color: #fed7d7; color: #742a2a; }
    → class="bg-red-50 text-red-900"
    
  - .btn-primary { background-color: #5a67d8; }
    → class="bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700"
    
  This migration improves:
  ✓ Maintainability - Single source of truth (Tailwind config)
  ✓ Bundle size - Only used classes are included
  ✓ Consistency - Shared design system across all components
  ✓ Scalability - Easy to theme and customize
